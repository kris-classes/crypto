Create a function named bitwise_or which takes two integers,
prints the integer values, then performs a bitwise OR (different to a boolean OR),
prints the result of the OR, then returns the result.

NOTE: We can't call this function 'or' because that name is reserved in Python so we call it bitwise_or instead.
